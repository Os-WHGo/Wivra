  Reference aid (third-party, MIT) for Wivra development: read an audience-retention CSV export and classify hook leak, cliffs and slide with retention.py. Use only when the owner supplies a retention export; needs at least 8 data points.

> **WIVRA RULES FOR THIS THIRD-PARTY SKILL (read first; they win over anything below).**
> - Source: https://github.com/Jakeschincariol/youtube-agent-skill/tree/main/skills/yt-retention (MIT, © 2026 Jake Schincariol), pinned commit `a2feb21`, selectively vendored. See `UPSTREAM.md` in this folder and `.claude/skills/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
> - This is a **reference/analysis aid for building Wivra's single editor**. It must NOT become a second editor, and must not replace an existing Wivra feature without first checking `docs/` and the code (do not rebuild what exists).
> - Never modify or overwrite the owner's original media (non-destructive). Write outputs only to a scratch/temporary folder or to a draft-PR branch, never to `main`.
> - Do NOT run any install command quoted below (`npx`, `pip`, `npm i`, `brew`, `git clone`, `claude plugin ...`, `ln -s`), do not download models, and do not call paid APIs or send media/text to third-party services. If something needs an install, tell the owner first.
> - Do not write outside the project (e.g. `~/.claude/...`) and do not publish/post anything to any account. Wivra publishes nothing without the owner's approval.
> - Study **observable functionality** of other apps only; never copy their code, assets, copy text, logos or distinctive UI (AGENTS.md rule 3). Slash-commands named below that are not installed here (e.g. `/ig-human`, `/yt-script`, `/replica-architect`) simply do not exist: skip those steps.
> - Wivra content is mostly **POV / outdoor / events (e.g. Ray-Ban), often without a face on camera**: rewrite any rule that assumes a talking head. Silence in a POV, hiking, concert or ambient clip is often intentional: never cut or call it "dead air" without the user's approval of each proposal (reversible suggestions, not automatic cuts).
> - Editorial numbers quoted below (e.g. -14 LUFS, 1.5 s shots, 3 s hooks, safe-zone pixels) are the author's house style, not universal standards: present them as options, not rules.
> - Mark claims as verified (with source) or not verified, and sign with the AI's name (AGENTS.md).



# yt-retention

The retention graph is the only honest feedback YouTube gives you. Almost nobody exports it.

```bash
python3 retention.py retention.csv --duration 600
python3 retention.py retention.csv --transcript transcript.srt
```

Getting the file: Studio -> a video -> Analytics -> Engagement -> the audience-retention chart ->
the download icon -> "Audience retention".

## Three different problems

- **HOOK LEAK** - what is lost in the first 30 seconds. Under 25% is healthy. This is always the
  first thing to fix and it is always the first fifteen seconds of script, never the edit.
- **CLIFFS** - single steep drops. A cliff is a moment: a topic change with no signposting, a
  sponsor read, a long setup. With `--transcript` the tool prints what was being said there, which
  is what makes the report actionable instead of interesting.
- **SLIDE** - the steady bleed across the middle. A flat slide is pacing. The fix is cutting, not
  rewriting.

## What to hand back

Name the single biggest leak and one change for it. Not a list of five. Then, only if asked, the
rest. And if the hook leak is healthy and the slide is flat, say the video is fine and the problem
is packaging - send them to `/yt-package`.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
